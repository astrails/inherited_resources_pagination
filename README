A very simple InheritedResources extension to paginate default collection helper

You will need will_paginate or an equivalent plugin to implement 'paginate' method on ActiveRrecord

Usage:
  - install as a plugin
  - include into InheritedResources::Base
    Note: loading the plugin will load InheritedResources::Base, which in turn will load ApplicationController
    if your ApplicationController requires some plugins to function you might have to control the plugins load order
    in your config/environment.rb. Something like:

    config.plugins = [:your-application-controller-dependency-plugin, :inherited_resources, :inherited_resources_pagination, :all]
